    - "Calculate the probability P(X >= 2) when X ~ N(3, 0.5), i.e., X is normally distributed with the mean of 3 and the variance of 0.5."
    - "Calculate the probability P(X < 0) when X ~ N(-2, 3), i.e., X is normally distributed with the mean of -2 and the variance of 3."
  26:
    - "Find y in P(X > y) = 0.6. X ~ N(0, 2), i.e., X is normally distributed with the mean of 0 and the variance of 2."
    - "Find y in P(X < y) = 0.2. X ~ t(40), i.e., X follows the t-distribution with 40 degrees of freedom."
    - "Find y in P(X > y) = 0.35. X ~ X^2(10), i.e., X follows the chi-square distribution with 10 degrees of freedom."
  27:
    - "Create a function removerows(x, k) which deletes every k:th row of the dataframe x, starting from the first row. For example, with k = 3, the function should delete the rows 1, 4, 7, ... ."
    - "Create a function ordercols(x) which arranges the columns of the dataframe x into alphabetical order based on their names. For example, if the original dataframe has the column order of C, A, B, the function should return a dataframe with the colum order of A, B, C."
  28:
    - "Create a function sumsq(x) which calculates the sum of squares of the vector x."
    - "Create a function fun(x, y) which takes two real numbers x and y as its arguments and returns the value 1 when x^2 + y^2 <= 1, and the value 0 otherwise. In other words, create a function which attains the value 1 inside unit circle, and the value 0 otherwise."
    - "Create a function statistics(x) which returns the following as a list: the vector x and its statistics obtained with the function summary. I.e., the list includes two items."
  29:
    - "Create a function kurtosis(x) which calculates the kurtosis of the sample vector x. The formula to calculate the kurtosis is included in the file formulas.pdf that can be found on the course page."
    - "Create a function skewness(x) which calculates the skewness of the sample vector x. The formula to calculate the skewness is included in the file formulas.pdf that can be found on the course page."

    - "Create a function likelihood(x, mu, sigma) which calculates the logarithmic likelihood function value of the normal distribution N(mu, sigma^2) (mean = mu, variance = sigma^2) based on the sample vector x. The formula of the logarithmic likelihood function is included in the file formulas.pdf that can be found on the course page."
    - "Create a function moments(x, k) which calculates the k first sample central moments and returns them as a vector. The parameter x is the sample vector and the parameter k is a positive integer. The formula to calculate the sample central moments is included in the file formulas.pdf that can be found on the course page."
